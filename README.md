# Introduction

You used to work as a freelance software developer, but now you've applied for a job as a developer at a large software development company. The company's management wants to test your skills, so as part of the recruitment process, they asked you to develop prototype applications for a Belle Croissant Lyonnais company.

In the prototype, all you need to develop is an import script, a dashboard and a searchable list of customers. The dashboard helps the operators to analyse the data. The list contains the customers and allows the operators to easily search information in them.

- Your API must use a [JSON Server stable version (v0)](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/tree/v0) as its data provider.
- Your UI has to use the provided logo.
- Finally you have to create a short demo video to show your presentation skills.

# Description of project and tasks

Your task is divided into four parts.

1. In the first part, you will develop a script to import functions and handle errors.
2. In the second part, you have to create a web based dashboard with a custom REST API.
3. In the third part, you will develop a searchable list for customers.
4. In the fourth part, you have to create a demo video.

# How to submit your work

1. To submit your work, you will need to share a GitHub repository (hereafter referred to as repo) containing the source code of your solution. We prefer that executable files or built solution are included in your repo too. If you have not used GitHub before, you can register an account at https://github.com and then create a private repo as `ws2026-s09-r1-YYY`, where `YYY` is the three-digit number we have emailed you. You then need to share the repo containing your solution with us. To do this, use our GitHub id `skillsithu`.
2. Just in case, send the link of your repo to ws2026s09@skillsit.hu.
4. Your README file has to contain the instructions how to start your project backend and frontend.
5. Submit your work no later than 25 February 2025 (Tuesday).
